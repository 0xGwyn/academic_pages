Hello, I'm Ali Dindamal and welcome to my academic website. In 2022, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering with an overall GPA of 3.43 out of 4.0 and a standout GPA of 3.92 out of 4.0 during the final two years of my studies at Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, where I emerged as the top student among 54 individuals.

Over the past years, I have been dedicated to expanding my skill set in various areas including programming, networking, Linux, databases, and web applications and their vulnerabilities. I have successfully completed projects that demonstrate my capabilities, such as the development of a [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing misconfiguration fuzzer](https://0xgwyn.github.io/posts/cors/) and the implementation of a [custom DNS brute forcing flow](https://0xgwyn.github.io/posts/dnsbrute/) or various other tools that are present in the [Projects and Presentations](https://0xgwyn.github.io/year-archive/) section. Additionally, I have gained valuable experience by participating in Bug Bounty programs, engaging in vulnerability discovery and assessment, as well as developing related tools for such tasks. I also have played the role of a [Teacher Assistant](https://0xgwyn.github.io/teaching/) in the Computer Networks course at my university.

This website serves as a platform to showcase my academic journey, accomplishments, and projects. Feel free to explore and learn more about my educational background and experiences. Also, the following video is essentially an overview of my academic journey.
