Summary
======
I delivered a concise presentation to my classmates, using Cloudflare's information on the OWASP Top 10 as my primary resource. As part of our web applications topic, I provided an overview of the vulnerabilities and categorizations listed in the OWASP Top 10, along with concise explanations of the corresponding security measures to prevent or mitigate these vulnerabilities.
