During my internship, I had the chance to dedicate my time to studying networking fundamentals and gain practical experience by creating various topologies and networks within [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer). As for the final task, I received a set of instructions to simulate a network for an imaginary organization with multiple components. Subsequently, I presented the completed network simulation to my supervisor.
