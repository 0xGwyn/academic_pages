Summary
======
During my internship, I had the chance to dedicate my time to studying networking fundamentals and gain practical experience by creating various topologies and networks within Cisco Packet Tracer. As for the final task, I received a set of instructions to simulate a network for an imaginary organization with multiple components. Subsequently, I presented the completed network simulation to my supervisor.
