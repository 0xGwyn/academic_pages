Robots.txt is a text file utilized by webmasters to guide web crawlers in their interactions with a website. It resides in the website's root directory and provides directives to specify which pages and directories should be crawled or excluded. By analyzing the paths mentioned in the robots.txt file, we can gain a deeper understanding of a web application and improve its mapping. This knowledge is valuable for tasks such as security assessments or vulnerability scanning.

Web Archive, on the other hand, is an online platform that captures snapshots of web pages over time. This tool leverages the archive by searching for older versions of robots.txt files associated with a website. The purpose is to identify previous paths or routes that were once included in the robots.txt file and could still exist in the current version of the application.

Overall, by referencing archived robots.txt files, this tool enables the discovery of hidden areas of web applications.
