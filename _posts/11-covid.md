Summary
======
Due to the significant impact and importance of the COVID-19 pandemic, I selected two datasets for my final project in the Data Mining course. My objective was to extract meaningful information from these datasets that could address the questions I had formulated at the beginning of the project. Furthermore, I developed visualizations to facilitate comparisons and effectively communicate the findings. In the final phase, I applied the K-means algorithm with three clusters to categorize the data based on the number of deceased and recovered patients.
