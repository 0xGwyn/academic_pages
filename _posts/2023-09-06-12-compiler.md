Summary
======
In the final project of the Compiler Design Fundamentals course, I utilized the PLY package in Python to create a lexical analyzer and parser for a simple custom programming language. The project encompassed defining tokens, special characters, and lexical rules, and subsequently designing grammar for the parser. By leveraging PLY's capabilities, I was able to develop and analyze the syntax and structure of the custom language.
