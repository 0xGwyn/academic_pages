The cache mapping tool is a simulation tool that supports different cache mapping types: direct mapping, fully associative mapping, and set-associative mapping. It takes parameters such as memory size, cache size, block size, and a hexadecimal address as input. The tool provides information on cache hit or miss, average access time, and the corresponding binary address.
