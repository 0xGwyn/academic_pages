Summary
======
In university, as part of the system analysis and design course project, we were required to select a profession from a given list and conduct research to identify its specific needs and the processes involved. Based on these data, I designed various diagrams, including activity diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, state machine diagrams, and use case diagrams, to depict the functional system.
